NOTE: these instructions assume you have postgres installed and running

1) Follow the instructions in the Postgres SQL folder README file
2) OK, at this point you should have your database created and have also updated app.env (DB_CONNECTSTRING) to match your new database. If you were successful you should be able to connect to postgres and query both public."Resources" and public."Journal" in your new database.
3) Now change the other env variables in app.env to be correct for your service.
